# Introduction üèÅ

‚ÄúAll men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness‚Äù. This well-known statement, which can be found in the second paragraph of the American Declaration of Independence drafted by Thomas Jefferson and adopted on July 4, 1776, has inspired through the centuries and still inspires millions of people to look for a better future in the United States of America. The same rhetoric is present in the very concept of the American Dream, ‚Äúthe ideal that every citizen of the United States should have an equal opportunity to achieve success and prosperity through hard work, determination, and initiative‚Äù (Oxford English Dictionary), that has pushed more than fifty million people to immigrate into the country (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs).

Undeniably, the history of the United States has been profoundly marked and transformed by immigration. Most of the American citizens nowadays have foreign ascendants, and only 2.6% (roughly nine million people) of the population identifies as Native American (US Census Bureau). The phenomenon of immigration, however, has assumed different modalities and connotations over the years. Indeed, during the colonial period, most immigrants were British or Germans; in the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Italians, Irish or Chinese; nowadays the migration flux mainly concerns the population from Latin American Countries (Baxter and Nowrasteh). The idea of immigration has always raised mixed feelings in the population and its representatives. Shortly after gaining independence from Great Britain, the US government started enacting a series of immigration regulations, with subsequent laws reflecting the prevailing politics and patterns of migrant influx. Initial legislation often imposed restrictions that favored Europeans, but a comprehensive law in 1965 ushered in an era of increased diversity by opening doors to immigrants from various regions. In contemporary times, laws and presidential initiatives have been influenced by issues related to refugees, unauthorized immigration, and concerns about terrorism (Pew Research Center). Famous is Donald Trump‚Äôs proposition of building a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico to stop illegal migrants from Latin America. The project, already conceived in the 1940s and 1950s by the Democrats Roosevelt and Truman, assured the former President a large popular support (Mendoza).

The ongoing debate around immigration is reflected in the media that, according to Baum and Potter, transports the elite‚Äôs view to the population and vice versa, in a circular motion, shaping public discourse and opinion (42). We thus decided to analyze how the debate around migration in the United States changed during the years by considering a corpus of articles published by the New York Times between 1945 and 2023.



# Research Topic ‚úç
To investigate the discourse around migration in the United States further, we would like to research on the change in the media framing of migration in the United States, from the period of post-World War II or 1945 until present. The media that we will focus on is the articles in The New York Times, one of the most prominent media in the United States.

We focus on the contemporary era or 1945-2023, due to the post-war migration after the World War II in 1945 and other global major situations that causes a dynamic flow of migration throughout the years. There is a possibility of changes in the discourse on migration throughout the various flows of migration occurrences, therefore, we believe that this research topic is worth pursuing.


# Context üåê
In the pre-modern era, the US has experienced three main waves of immigration. The first and most notorious one, considered the basis of the foundation of the country, happened during the colonial era, in 1620, when around 100 individuals, eventually recognized as the Pilgrims, escaped religious persecution in Europe and reached what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, founding a colony. Shortly afterward around 20,000 members of the persecuted religion Puritanism established the Massachusetts Bay Colony, between 1630 and 1640. The second group of immigrants was composed of West Africans, sold and enslaved in the New World (History Channel).

Between 1815 and 1865, another substantial wave of immigration swept the United States, with a focus on Northern and Western European countries. Notably, one-third of the newcomers, driven by the mid-19th-century Irish famine, consisted of Irish immigrants, comprising nearly half of America's total immigrant population in the 1840s. Simultaneously, about 5 million Germans arrived, with many settling in the Midwest or urban centers like Milwaukee and St. Louis. This period also marked the influx of Asian immigrants, particularly around 25,000 Chinese individuals drawn by the California gold rush in the mid-1800s. The impact of these diverse migrations significantly shaped the demographic landscape of the United States during this era (History Channel).

The third wave of immigration took place at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Between 1880 and 1920, a transformative era of industrialization and urbanization in the United States witnessed the arrival of over 20 million immigrants, the majority coming from Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe. Notable were the 600,000 Italians arriving in that decade, totaling over 4 million by 1920. Concurrently, more than 2 million Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe sought refuge from religious persecution. The peak of immigration occurred in 1907, welcoming around 1.3 million legal entrants. However, World War I's outbreak in 1914 led to a decline in immigration. In response, the Immigration Act of 1924 established a quota system, limiting entry to 2 percent of each nationality based on the 1890 census, favoring Western European immigrants and barring those from Asia. This legislative shift marked a turning point in U.S. immigration policy (History Channel).

The first conspicuous wave of Latin American immigrants started in 1942 with the repeal of the Bracero Program, a diplomatic agreement between Mexico and the United States, that facilitated the migration of millions of Mexican workers to the U.S. under short-term agricultural labor contracts. Post-war, special legislation enabled the entry of refugees from Europe and the Soviet Union into the U.S. Additionally, after the 1959 communist revolution in Cuba, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Cuba were admitted to the United States. In 1965, the Immigration and Nationality Act was passed by Congress, eliminating nationality-based quotas and permitting Americans to sponsor relatives from their countries of origin (History Channel).

To contrast the flux of illegal immigrants from Central America, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), enacted in 1986, granted amnesty to undocumented immigrants who had been residing continuously in the country since 1982 and imposed penalties on employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants. Subsequently, in 1990, Congress passed the Immigration Act, aiming to facilitate skilled worker immigration and substantially increased the annual issuance of green cards. Those legislations created resistance among the restrictionists, who claimed that immigration had negative economic and social effects. All along the 1990s a series of reforms both at the state and federal level, such as the California Propositions 187 and 227 or the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, tried to contain illegal immigration (Baxter and Nowrasteh).

In the early 2000s, President George W. Bush pursued a pro-immigration stance, particularly appealing to Hispanic voters with support for expanded legal immigration and legalization for undocumented immigrants. However, the 9/11 attacks prompted a shift in immigration policy, leading to the enactment of the USA Patriot Act, which expanded deportation powers and allowed detention without due process. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security followed, restructuring immigration enforcement agencies (Baxter and Nowrasteh).

The illegal immigration population peaked in 2007, becoming a prominent issue in the 2008 presidential election. Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, advocated for employer sanctions and earned legalization. By the 2012 presidential election, Obama, on the other hand, continued supporting comprehensive reform and targeted deportation for removing over 1.2 million illegal immigrants during his presidency. In comparison, Donald Trump removed fewer individuals, averaging approximately 81,415 per year during his term (Nowrasteh).


# Academic background üìó
As we have already stated, it is undeniable that the United States‚Äô history, culture and economics have been profoundly shaped by immigration, which started in the 17th century and has not stopped yet.  The perception of immigration in the media has been a topic of significant interest, being immigration a contentious issue. 

Mass media has always been a powerful tool to shape political and social debate. According to McQuail, ‚ÄúThe process of learning through the media [‚Ä¶] is often incidental, unplanned and unconscious for the receiver and almost always unintentional on the part of the sender‚Äù (13). One of the most prominent aspects of media involves presenting a coherent portrayal of the world, encouraging the audience to embrace this interpretation as a reality grounded in ‚Äúfacts‚Äù, norms, values, and expectations. Furthermore, there is an ongoing and selective interplay between oneself and the media, influencing the shaping of an individual's behavior and self-concept (McQuail 13-14). 

The media's portrayal of immigration has evolved over time, reflecting the changing societal attitudes and political climate. Research by Barbara Smith found that in the post-World War II era, the media often depicted immigrants as contributors to the economic growth and cultural diversity of the United States. This positive portrayal aimed to promote the idea of the United States as a nation of immigrants. 
However, as the political landscape changed, so did the media's portrayal of immigration. In the 1970s and ‚Äò80s, the media was linked to a perception of immigrants as potential sources of trouble or conflict. In this case, the primary role of mass media is not necessarily to promote prejudice, but rather to delineate the presence of immigrants as an ‚Äúobjective‚Äù societal issue. The media are associated with a view of immigrants as likely to be a cause of trouble or be associated with conflict (McQuail 15). Additional research by Johnson revealed that during periods of economic downturn and political tension, the media tended to emphasize negative stereotypes associated with immigrants. These stereotypes included portraying immigrants as criminals, job stealers, and a burden on social services (135-150).

In his book Covering Immigration: Popular Images and the Politics of the Nation, Chavez analyses the covers of different magazines during their years and their portrayals of immigration. The most relevant example of the shift in the narrative appeared on October 17, 1994, when the magazine The Nation had a cover story called ‚ÄúThe Immigration Wars‚Äù. The cover shows a picture of the Western U.S. border with lots of people walking towards it. In the front, there is the Statue of Liberty with an upside-down American flag, and a guard dog growling at a man with a backpack. This cover story highlighted how intense and powerful images and words on popular magazine covers can be when discussing anti-immigrant feelings (Chavez ch. 1).

The perception of immigration in the media is closely linked to political discourse. Research by Martinez (2018) highlighted that media coverage of immigration is often influenced by political agendas and rhetoric. The study found that during election cycles, media outlets aligned their coverage with the political ideologies of the candidates, leading to biased portrayals of immigrants.
Media framing plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion on immigration. According to Thompson, the media's framing of immigration issues significantly influenced public attitudes and policy preferences. The study found that when the media framed immigration as a threat to national security, public support for restrictive immigration policies increased.

The media's representation of immigrant communities has also been a subject of investigation. Research by Lee (2016) explored the portrayal of immigrant communities in television dramas and found that they were often depicted as exotic, foreign, and prone to criminal activities. This portrayal perpetuated stereotypes and reinforced negative perceptions of immigrants.
This literature review has provided an overview of the perception of immigration in the media in the United States from 1945 to 2023. The findings highlight the shifting narratives, the influence of political discourse, and the role of media framing in shaping public opinion. 


# Data & Methodology üìà
For the corpus, we are analyzing 10,132 articles from The New York Times, from the year 1945-2023.

In building the corpus, due to the NYT API's constraints when generating the corpus, we generated the articles by breaking them into six different corpus and concatenate them accordingly.


# I. Lexical extraction üìä
To identify the pattern in the articles about migration and the United States, we will extract several things based on the corpus:

a. 10 most frequently used adjectives in the headline and lead paragraph

b. 10 most frequently used nouns in the headline and lead paragraph

c. 10 most frequently used verbs

d. Distribution of verbs by tenses


# A. 10 Most Frequently Used Adjectives in the Lead Paragraph

![10 Most Used Adjectives](https://github.com/lidwinaput/CMA_FinalTerm_Migration/assets/151516433/0ed4a1da-39b0-4b77-a689-33c1e952494e)

Among the top 10 most frequently used adjectives in articles related to migration and the United States, the predominant descriptor is "new," suggesting a thematic emphasis on the novel aspects of migration‚Äîwhether in terms of fresh movements of people or the implementation of innovative policies.

Noteworthy adjectives like "American" and "political" further illuminate the lens through which migration news is presented in The New York Times. The use of "American" implies a perspective grounded in how the United States, its people, or policies perceive and respond to migration movements. This emphasis on the adjective "American" underscores a state-centric approach, wherein the portrayal of migration is filtered through the lens of the nation-state rather than centering on the experiences and perspectives of migrants themselves.

Similarly, the inclusion of the term "political" underscores the framing of migration issues in the United States as inherently political. Rather than viewing migration as a routine phenomenon involving the movement of people between countries, the media narrative appears to depict it as a political matter intricately linked to governmental policies. This framing suggests a deliberate choice to position migration as a political concern, influencing public discourse and shaping perceptions of the phenomenon as closely tied to government actions and decisions.

Among the most common adjectives, we can find more general others such as "more", "last", "first", etc. Those adjectives, being too vague, are however not useful for our analysis

In the corpus of articles pertaining to migration and the United States, an analysis employing named entity recognition reveals a notable concentration on specific nationalities and countries. Intriguingly, the majority of these entities‚Äîseven nouns, to be precise‚Äîare intricately linked to the United States itself. Concurrently, the names "Mexico"/"Mexican" and "China" emerge prominently beyond this central nexus, signifying their distinctive relevance in the discourse on migration.

This observation underscores a discernible thematic pattern within the narrative constructed by articles from the New York Times. The overarching focus revolves around elucidating the impact of migration on the United States and its citizenry ("Americans"). Significantly, the preeminent themes in the coverage of migration within the United States consistently gravitate towards China and Mexico, specifically Chinese and Mexican nationals.

As expected, the mention of Mexico or "Mexican" within the discourse is pronounced, primarily stemming from the substantial influx of immigrants from the country. The high volume of border crossings between Mexico and the United States catalyzes U.S. government actions, particularly during the Trump presidency, prompting initiatives such as the construction of border walls to impede further migration from Mexico.

The preeminence of China within the narrative of U.S. migration is multifaceted. Not only is China posited as a rising contender for global hegemony, but it has also evolved into a palpable political rival to the United States. Consequently, the news narrative in the U.S. tends to extensively cover developments related to China, including aspects of migration. This dual emphasis underscores the inextricable linkage between migration dynamics and the geopolitical dynamics between these two nations. 
Furthermore, the Chinese immigrant community is one of the biggest in the United States. The trajectory of Chinese migration reflects a noteworthy shift in recent years, particularly since 2012, with a steady rise in the number of Chinese nationals seeking asylum. The cumulative figure has surpassed 850,000, with the United States emerging as the primary host country, accommodating around 88,000 Chinese asylum seekers and an additional 66,000 individuals granted refugee status.
Notably, an unprecedented surge has been observed in the number of Chinese migrants apprehended at the Mexico-U.S. border, reaching nearly 10,000 since October 2022, marking the highest recorded figure. Nevertheless, the flux of immigration from China experienced a significant transformation in size and composition due to the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global migration patterns. Despite peaking at nearly 2.5 million in 2019, the number of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. dwindled to under 2.4 million in 2021, marking a departure from a prolonged period of growth. This decline can be attributed to the stringent migration restrictions imposed by the Trump administration during the early stages of the pandemic and the Chinese government's implementation of "zero-COVID" policies until late 2022.

In synthesizing the most frequently used nouns, it becomes evident that the narrative encapsulating migration and the United States remains distinctly fixated on two countries perceived to wield significant influence upon the nation‚ÄîChina and Mexico. This not only reflects the geopolitical realities but also underscores the intricate interplay between migration dynamics and broader global relationships within the ambit of U.S. news coverage.

Verbs in Future Tense : 41269


# Analysis
Based on the results, it is interesting that the most used verbs are in future tense, although the most used verbs is 'is' which is a very common to-be form.

In the articles, migration in the United States could be linked with aspiration, hence using future tense, or about the impact to the U.S., therefore using future tenses 'it will...'

The lack of using 'present tense' also shows how most of the news does not only present facts, it could also show what happened before and what will be the consequences (future)

# Analysis

From the analysis of the number of articles on migration and US per year, the highest number of publications is in the year 2019. The year 2019 is the year when Trump implemented the 'Migrant Protection Protocols' or the 'Remain in Mexico' immigration policy, which affects immigration across the border with Mexico.

The policy is aimed to restrict the number of migrants coming to US, however, more migrants come crossing the border during that year, which shows how restrictive policy isn't necessarily effective to curb immigration.

# Analysis

For the words used in the articles, a high amount of words are used in articles from 1990 until mid 2005, which could be because of the amount of migration and the increase of perception of migration as a threat that occurred during that time (post-Cold War and post 9/11)

The graphical representation illustrating word occurrences reveals a persistent utilization of the term "migrants" and a notable frequency of the word "immigration." Notably, the term "Mexico" is frequently employed, particularly in the period extending from the year 2000 onwards. In comparison, the term "China" is also prevalent, albeit to a lesser extent than "Mexico."

Upon closer examination of the articles referencing Mexico and its corresponding adjective "Mexican," a discernible thematic focus emerges. Predominantly, the discourse revolves around border policies, underscored by recurrent mentions of Mexican migrants. Conversely, when considering the term "China," the narrative extends beyond mere discussions of immigration from China to the United States. Instead, it encompasses a broader spectrum, encompassing reflections on China as a nation and its formidable geopolitical influence, which presents formidable challenges to the United States.

This linguistic analysis underscores a nuanced discourse surrounding migration, where Mexico features prominently in discussions primarily related to border policies and the experiences of Mexican migrants. On the other hand, the term "China" unfolds as a multifaceted topic, intertwining discussions about immigration with broader considerations of China's geopolitical prowess vis-√†-vis the United States. The distinct thematic trajectories underscore the complexity and diversity inherent in the discourse surrounding these two nations within the context of migration.

Among the most common names mentioned, the first one in terms of frequency is Donald J. Trump or Trump. This shows how the news related to migration is almost always related to the president who implement the policy about migration.
