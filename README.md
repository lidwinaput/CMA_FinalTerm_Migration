# Introduction üèÅ

‚ÄúAll men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness‚Äù. This well-known statement, which can be found in the second paragraph of the American Declaration of Independence drafted by Thomas Jefferson and adopted on July 4, 1776, has inspired through the centuries and still inspires millions of people to look for a better future in the United States of America. The same rhetoric is present in the very concept of the American Dream, ‚Äúthe ideal that every citizen of the United States should have an equal opportunity to achieve success and prosperity through hard work, determination, and initiative‚Äù (Oxford English Dictionary), that has pushed more than fifty million people to immigrate into the country (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs).

Undeniably, the history of the United States has been profoundly marked and transformed by immigration. Most of the American citizens nowadays have foreign ascendants, and only 2.6% (roughly nine million people) of the population identifies as Native American (US Census Bureau). The phenomenon of immigration, however, has assumed different modalities and connotations over the years. Indeed, during the colonial period, most immigrants were British or Germans; in the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Italians, Irish or Chinese; nowadays the migration flux mainly concerns the population from Latin American Countries (Baxter and Nowrasteh). The idea of immigration has always raised mixed feelings in the population and its representatives. Shortly after gaining independence from Great Britain, the US government started enacting a series of immigration regulations, with subsequent laws reflecting the prevailing politics and patterns of migrant influx. Initial legislation often imposed restrictions that favored Europeans, but a comprehensive law in 1965 ushered in an era of increased diversity by opening doors to immigrants from various regions. In contemporary times, laws and presidential initiatives have been influenced by issues related to refugees, unauthorized immigration, and concerns about terrorism (Pew Research Center). Famous is Donald Trump‚Äôs proposition of building a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico to stop illegal migrants from Latin America. The project, already conceived in the 1940s and 1950s by the Democrats Roosevelt and Truman, assured the former President a large popular support (Mendoza).

The ongoing debate around immigration is reflected in the media that, according to Baum and Potter, transports the elite‚Äôs view to the population and vice versa, in a circular motion, shaping public discourse and opinion (42). We thus decided to analyze how the debate around migration in the United States changed during the years by considering a corpus of articles published by the New York Times between 1945 and 2023.



# Research Topic ‚úç
To investigate the discourse around migration in the United States further, we would like to research on the change in the media framing of migration in the United States, from the period of post-World War II or 1945 until present. The media that we will focus on is the articles in The New York Times, one of the most prominent media in the United States.

We focus on the contemporary era or 1945-2023, due to the post-war migration after the World War II in 1945 and other global major situations that causes a dynamic flow of migration throughout the years. There is a possibility of changes in the discourse on migration throughout the various flows of migration occurrences, therefore, we believe that this research topic is worth pursuing.


# Context üåê
In the pre-modern era, the US has experienced three main waves of immigration. The first and most notorious one, considered the basis of the foundation of the country, happened during the colonial era, in 1620, when around 100 individuals, eventually recognized as the Pilgrims, escaped religious persecution in Europe and reached what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, founding a colony. Shortly afterward around 20,000 members of the persecuted religion Puritanism established the Massachusetts Bay Colony, between 1630 and 1640. The second group of immigrants was composed of West Africans, sold and enslaved in the New World (History Channel).

Between 1815 and 1865, another substantial wave of immigration swept the United States, with a focus on Northern and Western European countries. Notably, one-third of the newcomers, driven by the mid-19th-century Irish famine, consisted of Irish immigrants, comprising nearly half of America's total immigrant population in the 1840s. Simultaneously, about 5 million Germans arrived, with many settling in the Midwest or urban centers like Milwaukee and St. Louis. This period also marked the influx of Asian immigrants, particularly around 25,000 Chinese individuals drawn by the California gold rush in the mid-1800s. The impact of these diverse migrations significantly shaped the demographic landscape of the United States during this era (History Channel).

The third wave of immigration took place at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Between 1880 and 1920, a transformative era of industrialization and urbanization in the United States witnessed the arrival of over 20 million immigrants, the majority coming from Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe. Notable were the 600,000 Italians arriving in that decade, totaling over 4 million by 1920. Concurrently, more than 2 million Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe sought refuge from religious persecution. The peak of immigration occurred in 1907, welcoming around 1.3 million legal entrants. However, World War I's outbreak in 1914 led to a decline in immigration. In response, the Immigration Act of 1924 established a quota system, limiting entry to 2 percent of each nationality based on the 1890 census, favoring Western European immigrants and barring those from Asia. This legislative shift marked a turning point in U.S. immigration policy (History Channel).

The first conspicuous wave of Latin American immigrants started in 1942 with the repeal of the Bracero Program, a diplomatic agreement between Mexico and the United States, that facilitated the migration of millions of Mexican workers to the U.S. under short-term agricultural labor contracts. Post-war, special legislation enabled the entry of refugees from Europe and the Soviet Union into the U.S. Additionally, after the 1959 communist revolution in Cuba, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Cuba were admitted to the United States. In 1965, the Immigration and Nationality Act was passed by Congress, eliminating nationality-based quotas and permitting Americans to sponsor relatives from their countries of origin (History Channel).

To contrast the flux of illegal immigrants from Central America, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), enacted in 1986, granted amnesty to undocumented immigrants who had been residing continuously in the country since 1982 and imposed penalties on employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants. Subsequently, in 1990, Congress passed the Immigration Act, aiming to facilitate skilled worker immigration and substantially increased the annual issuance of green cards. Those legislations created resistance among the restrictionists, who claimed that immigration had negative economic and social effects. All along the 1990s a series of reforms both at the state and federal level, such as the California Propositions 187 and 227 or the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, tried to contain illegal immigration (Baxter and Nowrasteh).

In the early 2000s, President George W. Bush pursued a pro-immigration stance, particularly appealing to Hispanic voters with support for expanded legal immigration and legalization for undocumented immigrants. However, the 9/11 attacks prompted a shift in immigration policy, leading to the enactment of the USA Patriot Act, which expanded deportation powers and allowed detention without due process. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security followed, restructuring immigration enforcement agencies (Baxter and Nowrasteh).

The illegal immigration population peaked in 2007, becoming a prominent issue in the 2008 presidential election. Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, advocated for employer sanctions and earned legalization. By the 2012 presidential election, Obama, on the other hand, continued supporting comprehensive reform and targeted deportation for removing over 1.2 million illegal immigrants during his presidency. In comparison, Donald Trump removed fewer individuals, averaging approximately 81,415 per year during his term (Nowrasteh).


# Academic background üìó
As previously articulated, the enduring impact of immigration on the history, culture, and economics of the United States is indisputable, spanning back to the 17th century and persisting into contemporary times. The representation of immigration in the media has emerged as a subject of considerable scrutiny, given the contentious nature of the issue.

Mass media, recognized as a potent instrument for shaping political and social discourse, operates in a manner described by McQuail as an incidental, unplanned, and often unconscious process for the audience, unintentionally influenced by the sender. Central to this influence is the media's capacity to present a cohesive depiction of the world, urging the audience to adopt this interpretation as a reality founded on "facts," norms, values, and expectations. The reciprocal interaction between individuals and the media further contributes to the molding of behavior and self-concept (McQuail 13-14).

The portrayal of immigration in the media has evolved over time, mirroring shifts in societal attitudes and the political climate. Noteworthy research by Barbara Smith underscores that post-World War II, the media predominantly depicted immigrants as contributors to the nation's economic growth and cultural diversity, fostering the idea of the United States as a nation of immigrants. However, as the political landscape underwent transformations, so did the media's portrayal of immigration. In the 1970s and '80s, the media became associated with depicting immigrants as potential sources of trouble or conflict, not necessarily to propagate prejudice but to delineate their presence as an "objective" societal issue. Johnson's research further illuminates that during periods of economic downturn and political tension, the media tended to accentuate negative stereotypes of immigrants, characterizing them as criminals, job usurpers, and burdens on social services (135-150).

In his comprehensive examination titled "Covering Immigration: Popular Images and the Politics of the Nation," Chavez scrutinizes magazine covers over the years. A pivotal example of a narrative shift occurred on October 17, 1994, when The Nation's cover story, "The Immigration Wars," depicted a scene at the Western U.S. border with powerful imagery symbolizing anti-immigrant sentiments. This instance underscores the impactful convergence of visuals and words on popular magazine covers in shaping public perceptions (Chavez ch. 1).

The media's portrayal of immigration is intricately intertwined with political discourse, as illuminated by Martinez's research in 2018. Media coverage, particularly during election cycles, aligns with political ideologies, resulting in biased portrayals of immigrants. Media framing emerges as a pivotal factor shaping public opinion on immigration, with Thompson's study demonstrating that framing immigration as a threat to national security correlates with increased public support for restrictive policies.

Beyond the broader narrative, the representation of immigrant communities within media has undergone scrutiny, with Lee's research revealing that television dramas often depicted them as exotic, foreign, and prone to criminal activities, perpetuating stereotypes and reinforcing negative perceptions.

This comprehensive literature review encapsulates the nuanced dynamics of the perception of immigration in the U.S. media from 1945 to 2023, shedding light on evolving narratives, the symbiotic relationship with political discourse, and the influential role of media framing in shaping public sentiment and policy preferences.

# Data & Methodology üìà
For the corpus, we are analyzing 10,132 articles from The New York Times, from the year 1945-2023.

In building the corpus, due to the NYT API's constraints when generating the corpus, we generated the articles by breaking them into six different corpus and concatenating them accordingly.


# I. Lexical extraction üìä
To identify the pattern in the articles about migration and the United States, we will extract several things based on the corpus:

a. 10 most frequently used adjectives

b. 10 most frequently used nouns in the headline and lead paragraph

c. 10 most frequently used verbs

d. Distribution of verbs by tenses

![10 Most Used Adjectives-New](https://github.com/lidwinaput/CMA_FinalTerm_Migration/assets/151516433/4ff05d7d-bed5-43da-b441-2fc2e6e59472)

# A. 10 Most Frequently Used Adjectives



Among the top 10 most frequently used adjectives in articles related to migration and the United States, the predominant descriptor is "new," suggesting a thematic emphasis on the novel aspects of migration‚Äîwhether in terms of fresh movements of people or the implementation of innovative policies.

Noteworthy adjectives like "American" and "political" further illuminate the lens through which migration news is presented in The New York Times. The use of "American" implies a perspective grounded in how the United States, its people, or policies perceive and respond to migration movements. This emphasis on the adjective "American" underscores a state-centric approach, wherein the portrayal of migration is filtered through the lens of the nation-state rather than centering on the experiences and perspectives of migrants themselves.

Similarly, the inclusion of the term "political" underscores the framing of migration issues in the United States as inherently political. Rather than viewing migration as a routine phenomenon involving the movement of people between countries, the media narrative appears to depict it as a political matter intricately linked to governmental policies. This framing suggests a deliberate choice to position migration as a political concern, influencing public discourse and shaping perceptions of the phenomenon as closely tied to government actions and decisions.

The term "black," which is used frequently, is another adjective that is noted in the articles. This could refer to colour in the literal sense, but could also be a reference to African Americans, showing how when talking about migration, The New York Times also still discuss about the African-American descent in the U.S. and their possible migration within and outside of the U.S.

Among the most common adjectives, we can find more general others such as "many", "last", "first", etc. Those adjectives, being too vague, are however not useful for our analysis

![10 Most Common Nouns - New](https://github.com/lidwinaput/CMA_FinalTerm_Migration/assets/151516433/e8262e1d-250b-4670-bad6-6b8f34f1439e)



In the corpus of articles pertaining to migration and the United States, an analysis employing named entity recognition reveals a notable concentration on specific nationalities and countries. Intriguingly, the majority of these entities‚Äîseven nouns, to be precise‚Äîare intricately linked to the United States itself. Concurrently, the names "Mexico"/"Mexican" and "China" emerge prominently beyond this central nexus, signifying their distinctive relevance in the discourse on migration.

This observation underscores a discernible thematic pattern within the narrative constructed by articles from the New York Times. The overarching focus revolves around elucidating the impact of migration on the United States and its citizenry ("Americans"). The recurrent mention of Washington D.C. is to be attributed to the political importance of the city, that is the capital and the headquarters of the US' political life, with the Capitol and the White House. Significantly, the preeminent themes in the coverage of migration within the United States consistently gravitate towards China and Mexico, specifically Chinese and Mexican nationals.

As expected, the mention of Mexico or "Mexican" within the discourse is pronounced, primarily stemming from the substantial influx of immigrants from the country. The high volume of border crossings between Mexico and the United States catalyzes U.S. government actions, particularly during the Trump presidency, prompting initiatives such as the construction of border walls to impede further migration from Mexico.

The preeminence of China within the narrative of U.S. migration is multifaceted. Not only is China posited as a rising contender for global hegemony, but it has also evolved into a palpable political rival to the United States. Consequently, the news narrative in the U.S. tends to extensively cover developments related to China, including aspects of migration. This dual emphasis underscores the inextricable linkage between migration dynamics and the geopolitical dynamics between these two nations. 
Furthermore, the Chinese immigrant community is one of the biggest in the United States. The trajectory of Chinese migration reflects a noteworthy shift in recent years, particularly since 2012, with a steady rise in the number of Chinese nationals seeking asylum. The cumulative figure has surpassed 850,000, with the United States emerging as the primary host country, accommodating around 88,000 Chinese asylum seekers and an additional 66,000 individuals granted refugee status.
Notably, an unprecedented surge has been observed in the number of Chinese migrants apprehended at the Mexico-U.S. border, reaching nearly 10,000 since October 2022, marking the highest recorded figure. Nevertheless, the flux of immigration from China experienced a significant transformation in size and composition due to the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global migration patterns. Despite peaking at nearly 2.5 million in 2019, the number of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. dwindled to under 2.4 million in 2021, marking a departure from a prolonged period of growth. This decline can be attributed to the stringent migration restrictions imposed by the Trump administration during the early stages of the pandemic and the Chinese government's implementation of "zero-COVID" policies until late 2022.

In synthesizing the most frequently used nouns, it becomes evident that the narrative encapsulating migration and the United States remains distinctly fixated on two countries perceived to wield significant influence upon the nation‚ÄîChina and Mexico. This not only reflects the geopolitical realities but also underscores the intricate interplay between migration dynamics and broader global relationships within the ambit of U.S. news coverage.


# C. Most Frequently Used Verbs


![10 Most Used Verbs - New](https://github.com/lidwinaput/CMA_FinalTerm_Migration/assets/151516433/f82d5033-87d4-4cbd-aa16-957489aac940)


# D. Distribution of Verbs by Tenses


![Distribution of Verbs Tenses - New](https://github.com/lidwinaput/CMA_FinalTerm_Migration/assets/151516433/e2d6cbc9-d4a5-423c-8ffc-329c37eaaacd)



Verbs in Past Tense: 11104

Verbs in Present Tense: 4072

Verbs in Future Tense: 41269



The analysis of verb frequency in the corpus reveals a noteworthy prevalence of the verbs "to be" and "to have," with a distinct emphasis on the form "is." However, given their ubiquitous use, often in auxiliary roles, and the absence of nuanced significance, these findings are deemed less relevant for our analytical purposes.

Intriguingly, the examination of verb usage exposes an interesting pattern, as the most frequently employed verbs are situated in the future tense. This observation prompts consideration of a potential correlation between the prevalent use of future tense verbs and the discourse surrounding migration in the United States. One plausible interpretation suggests a thematic alignment with the aspirational dimension of formulating new policies to curtail migration. Alternatively, the future tense may be indicative of a broader contemplation of the impending impact of migration on the future political, economic, social, and cultural fabric of the United States.

The conspicuous absence of the 'present tense' in verb usage further underscores a distinctive characteristic of the news articles. Rather than merely presenting factual information, the narrative appears to extend beyond the immediate present, delving into both historical contexts and prospective consequences. This temporal breadth suggests a comprehensive examination of the migration phenomenon, encapsulating not only its current manifestations but also its antecedents and the anticipated ramifications on the future trajectory of the United States in various spheres.

In essence, the predominance of future tense verbs serves as a linguistic marker, potentially mirroring the dual emphasis on future-oriented policy considerations and the broader, lasting implications of migration on the multifaceted dimensions of American society.



# II. Name of Public Figures

The most frequently mentioned names of public figures:

![Top 10 Public Figures Mentioned - New](https://github.com/lidwinaput/CMA_FinalTerm_Migration/assets/151516433/a2f74899-844a-49ac-95a4-7e3ae4669a6b)


The frequency analysis of mentioned names in the New York Times articles on migration reveals a significant prevalence of Donald J. Trump (mentioned around 450 times), emphasizing the deeply intertwined connection between migration-related news and the presidency. If we consider that we decided to analyze a span of eighty years, we can see how Trump's presidency (which lasted four years) elevated migration to a prominent national topic.

Following Trump, the names of Biden (around 200 times) and Kamala Harris (around thirty times) emerge as frequently cited figures, highlighting the continued importance of migration during Biden's presidency. Notably, Biden's administration introduced new border enforcement actions, signaling a shift towards stricter immigration policies, particularly concerning unauthorized migration.

Several U.S. political figures, such as George W. Bush (150 times), Barack Obama (130), Bill Clinton (fifty times), Ronald Reagan (forty times), Jimmy Carter (forty times) and Richard Nixon (twenty times), are also prominently mentioned in migration-related discussions, reflecting their roles and policies concerning immigration during their respective presidencies.

Beyond U.S. political figures, international political leaders like Fidel Castro, Vicente Fox and Angela Merkel are notably referenced ‚Äì respectively mentioned sixty, fifty and thirty times. Fidel Castro‚Äôs mention is linked to the Cuban exodus following the 1959 revolution, resulting in a significant refugee influx into the United States (Duany). The migration of Cubans to the U.S. has historically marked Castro‚Äôs legacy and the subsequent impact on U.S. migration policies.

Vicente Fox, Mexico's former president, collaborated with George W. Bush to advocate for Mexican migrants‚Äô rights in the United States, recognizing its significance in domestic political spheres (Leiken).

Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, gained attention for her ‚Äúopen-door‚Äù migration policy in 2015, accepting a substantial number of refugees in the country. While Germany's immigration policies have evolved, references to Merkel in U.S. migration discussions might denote comparisons or considerations in shaping U.S. immigration policy.

Additional names like Bantam (mentioned thirty times), Brexit (thirty times), and Charles J. Givens (twenty times), offering diverse contextual references, might be tangentially associated with U.S. migration discourse, reflecting nuanced connections or comparative considerations in related articles. To explain the recurrence of ‚ÄúBrexit‚Äù, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union happened in 2020, we have to consider that one of the main reasons for a large number of favorable votes was the campaign around the limitation of immigration. Concerning Bantam, we found out that it is a town in Connecticut, but no further relevant information is available. Charles J. Givens is a bestselling author of three books about wealth and financial strategies; again, his link with the topic of immigration is mostly tangential. It is also interesting to notice how the algorithm mistakes the nouns ‚ÄúBrexit‚Äù and ‚ÄúBantam‚Äù for public figures.

These diverse references underscore the multifaceted nature of migration discussions, weaving together national and international political figures, historical events, and comparative contexts to enrich the discourse on migration in the United States.





# III. Temporal evolution ‚è∞

# a. Number of Articles Published Annually

![Number of Articles Published Annually](https://github.com/lidwinaput/CMA_FinalTerm_Migration/assets/151516433/deed401d-fe74-482f-8dfa-7e61a09b0e40)

The analysis of annual articles on migration and the United States indicates that from 1946 to 1970, there was minimal media discourse on immigration, signifying its relatively low relevance in American society during that period. An exception occurred in 1964, coinciding with discussions surrounding the Immigration and Nationality Act. Signed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965, this legislation marked a significant departure by abolishing the National Origins Formula, ending de facto discrimination against certain ethnicities in U.S. immigration policy and introducing numerical limits on immigration from the Western Hemisphere.

The 1970s marked the commencement of widespread discussions on immigration in the U.S., with notable events shaping the discourse. The Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, responding to the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War, facilitated the entry of approximately 130,000 refugees from South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Another pivotal year was 1991, following the enactment of the Immigration Act of 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, which instituted comprehensive reforms, affecting overall immigration numbers and introducing new visa categories.

The 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 elevated the immigration discourse, prompting scrutiny of the U.S. immigration and visa system. The ensuing discussions highlighted flaws and resulted in increased apprehension regarding the government's vetting processes. Subsequent legislative actions, such as the Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, fueled extensive debates.

In 2011, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, signed by President Obama in 2012, sparked discussions, and from 2015 onward, there was a consistent surge in articles related to immigration. This escalation is attributed to Donald Trump's candidacy and presidency, during which he emphasized restrictive immigration policies, including the proposal to expel irregular immigrants and build a border wall with Mexico.

The peak in the number of publications occurred in 2019, coinciding with the implementation of the "Migrant Protection Protocols" or the "Remain in Mexico" immigration policy by President Trump. Despite the policy's intent to restrict migration, the data suggests an increase in border crossings, raising questions about the effectiveness of such restrictive measures.

Post-2019, the intensity of the immigration debate persisted but slowed, potentially influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and related policies impacting freedom of movement.


# b. Word Count per Article

![word count per article](https://github.com/lidwinaput/CMA_FinalTerm_Migration/assets/151516433/40df6bd3-c86f-4396-82ce-f51b05c1a7a1)

The analysis of word count per article provides insights into the dynamics of media discourse on immigration, suggesting a relationship between the intensity of societal and media discussions and the length and detail of articles. Broadly speaking, it can be hypothesized that as a topic gains prominence in both the media and society, articles tend to be more accurate, detailed, and consequently, longer.

The observed trends in word count align with the overarching patterns identified in the analysis of the number of articles published per year on immigration. Notably, during periods marked by the promulgation of significant laws and reforms, such as the Immigration Act of 1990 under President George H.W. Bush, and in the aftermath of the 9/11 events in the mid-2000s, the word count per article experienced notable peaks. This correlation suggests that major legislative developments and impactful events stimulate more extensive and detailed discussions in the media. In particular, we can imagine that, because the terrorist attacks have been so traumatic and deeply disturbing for the whole American society ‚Äì and not only those interested in politics or political matters ‚Äì the journalists wrote longer articles to detail the dynamic of the events to appeal the general public and raise empathy and compassion for the victims and their families.

However, a noteworthy inversion of this correlation becomes evident from the 2010s onward. Despite the continued increase in the number of articles published per year, the word count per article has remained relatively constant and low. This phenomenon is attributed to the proliferation of internet and online news platforms. The immediacy afforded by these platforms enables journalists to swiftly publish breaking news without exhaustive detail. Additional information can then be supplemented in subsequent articles as events unfold.

Furthermore, the influence of new technologies and social media on information consumption patterns is significant. The fast-paced nature of these platforms encourages brevity and immediate dissemination of news. The diminishing attention span of the audience, as revealed in a survey by King's College London, further contributes to the preference for shorter and more concise articles among journalists. In this context, brevity becomes a strategic choice to engage a larger audience rapidly.

In conclusion, the intricate interplay between societal trends, media dynamics, and technological advancements shapes the length and detail of articles on immigration. While historical events and legislative changes may prompt more extensive coverage, the contemporary landscape, characterized by the rapid dissemination of information online, necessitates concise and immediate reporting to cater to evolving patterns of information consumption.

Chosen words: China; Mexico; immigration; migrants; policy

We decided to choose the previous words because, from the analysis conducted so far, we found them particularly relevant for our topic.

The visual representation depicting word occurrences offers valuable insights into the thematic landscape of articles on migration. As we expected, being our chosen subject, the terms ‚Äúmigrants‚Äù and ‚Äúimmigration‚Äù persistently dominate the discourse, indicating their central role in the narrative. Following the historical trends presented in the previous parts, we acknowledge that the topic generated little interest until the 2000s ‚Äì with rare exceptions ‚Äì to gain importance from 2001 on, after 9/11. Talking about 9/11, we can find a relation with the occurrence of the word ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù: indeed, in the first half of the 2000s, strict anti-immigration laws were enacted to enforce national security. The weekly occurrence of the words ‚Äúimmigration‚Äù and ‚Äúmigrants‚Äù peaked in the middle of the 2010s and the beginning of the 2020s, due to Trump‚Äôs ferocious fight against illegal immigration.

Taking inspiration from the lexical extraction part, we decided to plot two of the most recurrent words, China and Mexico. the recurrence of the mention of ‚ÄúMexico‚Äù is particularly notable, with a discernible increase in frequency, commencing from the year 2000 onward.

A closer examination of articles featuring references to Mexico and its associated descriptor "Mexican" unveils a thematic concentration primarily on border policies, with a recurrent emphasis on the experiences of Mexican migrants. This thematic coherence underscores the significance of Mexico in discussions surrounding migration, with a focal point on policy considerations related to the U.S.-Mexico border and the journeys of Mexican migrants. Surprisingly, the recurrence of such a word between 2005 and 2010 is related to an inversion of the immigration trend: according to the Pew Research Center, the number of Mexican-born immigrants who left the U.S. for Mexico rose sharply from 2005 to 2010, even as the flow of new immigrants to the U.S. from Mexico fell steeply. As a result, net Mexican immigration to the U.S. is at a standstill, and the Mexican-born population in the U.S. leveled off and then declined in the last half of the 2000s. Of course, the major weekly peak of the word happened during Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency between 2016 and 2020.

Even if not as present as ‚ÄúMexico‚Äù, the word China is still recurrent in the New York Times articles. The discourse related to ‚ÄúChina‚Äù extends beyond a singular focus on immigration from China to the United States ‚Äì even if this aspect is relevant as well. Instead, it encompasses a more expansive narrative that delves into China's identity as a nation and its substantial geopolitical influence. This broader perspective acknowledges China's role as a formidable global player, presenting challenges and complexities in its relationship with the United States beyond the realm of immigration. The weekly occurrence of the word ‚ÄúChina‚Äù peaked in 2005, probably due to the inter-census population survey, in which migrants were registered at both their place of original residence and at their destination. The 2005 census has been extremely relevant to studying Chinese citizens‚Äô migration patterns, but it mostly focuses on the phenomenon within the country. Thus, we do not find this result particularly relevant to our analysis.

# V. Sentiment Analysis


![Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/lidwinaput/CMA_FinalTerm_Migration/assets/151516433/293288d4-ece1-4dc2-bf5b-57e0dfd7b5b3)

Contrary to our first hypothesis, the majority (around 6000) of the articles about migration in the New York Times convey positive sentiments, whereas less than half of them are negatively framed. Interpreting why this happens involves considering several factors related to journalism practices, the nature of the content, and possibly the methodology of the sentiment analysis itself. 

The most plausible explanation is that the New York Times, like many reputable news outlets, often adopts a formal, balanced, and nuanced style of reporting. This might result in language that is less extreme and more measured, which could be interpreted as more positive by sentiment analysis tools. However, despite its neutral style of reporting, it is known that sometimes the New York Times tends to adopt a more center-left vision. Positive sentiment in articles about migration could be due to a focus on human interest stories that highlight success, resilience, or positive aspects of the immigrant experience.

If the dataset includes articles focusing on positive aspects of migration, such as community support, successful integration, or contributions of immigrants to society, this will skew the sentiment analysis results towards the positive. In addition to this, certain words or phrases might have different connotations in the context of migration and could be interpreted differently by sentiment analysis tools.

It is thus important to approach the results of sentiment analysis with a critical understanding of these various factors. Sentiment analysis provides a quantitative measure, but interpreting these results requires qualitative judgment and consideration of context, editorial practices, and the tool‚Äôs limitations.


# VI. Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis of articles about migration in the United States, as published by The New York Times, not only delineates discursive patterns and thematic emphases but also delves into the affective dimension inherent in the narratives. Through the application of sentiment analysis, it was observed that the majority of these articles exude a predominantly positive character.

The recurrent use of adjectives such as "new," "American," "political," and "black" not only lends semantic richness to the analysis but also suggests an intrinsic optimistic tone in the journalistic treatment of the migration phenomenon. This positivity may reflect an intention to highlight success stories, political innovations, and ethnic and racial diversity in the context of migration, counterbalancing any challenges presented in the narratives.

In the substantive realm, the concentration on terms like "United States," "Mexico," and "China" acquires a positive nuance by accentuating the favorable interactions and partnerships between these countries, even amidst discussions on migratory issues. Such an approach can contribute to promoting a more harmonious and cooperative vision in international migration debates.

The prevalence of future tense verbs, analyzed in the light of sentiment, may indicate a hopeful and constructive orientation in discussions about migratory policies. The prospect of shaping the future through more inclusive policies and innovative approaches is underscored, suggesting a proactive stance in addressing migratory challenges.
The inclusion of public figures such as Donald J. Trump, Biden, and international leaders, framed within the context of sentiment analysis, reveals affective nuances in the representations of these personalities. The positive or negative perception of these political actors can influence the overall tone of the articles, impacting the public's perception of migratory policies and their implications.

The temporal examination, revealing inflections correlated to historical events, is also imbued with a positive inclination, highlighting the progress achieved in various epochs. The post-2019 deceleration, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests a reflective and measured adaptation to exceptional circumstances, in harmony with the overall optimistic tone.
The lexical evolution analysis, incorporating sentiment analysis, reveals emotional nuances around the selected keywords. The prominence of "Mexico" and "China" not only reflects geopolitical relevance but also suggests a constructive and collaborative approach in discussions about migration with these countries.

In summary, this academically enriched analysis, complemented by sentiment analysis, offers a more holistic understanding of the discourse on migration in the United States. By acknowledging the predominance of a positive tone, the importance of a balanced and inclusive approach in journalistic discussions is reinforced, contributing to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the complexities associated with the migratory phenomenon.
