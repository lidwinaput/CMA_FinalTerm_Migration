# Introduction üèÅ

‚ÄúAll men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness‚Äù. This well-known statement, which can be found in the second paragraph of the American Declaration of Independence drafted by Thomas Jefferson and adopted on July 4, 1776, has inspired through the centuries and still inspires millions of people to look for a better future in the United States of America. The same rhetoric is present in the very concept of the American Dream, ‚Äúthe ideal that every citizen of the United States should have an equal opportunity to achieve success and prosperity through hard work, determination, and initiative‚Äù (Oxford English Dictionary), that has pushed more than fifty million people to immigrate into the country (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs).

Undeniably, the history of the United States has been profoundly marked and transformed by immigration. Most of the American citizens nowadays have foreign ascendants, and only 2.6% (roughly nine million people) of the population identifies as Native American (US Census Bureau). The phenomenon of immigration, however, has assumed different modalities and connotations over the years. Indeed, during the colonial period, most immigrants were British or Germans; in the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Italians, Irish or Chinese; nowadays the migration flux mainly concerns the population from Latin American Countries (Baxter and Nowrasteh). The idea of immigration has always raised mixed feelings in the population and its representatives. Shortly after gaining independence from Great Britain, the US government started enacting a series of immigration regulations, with subsequent laws reflecting the prevailing politics and patterns of migrant influx. Initial legislation often imposed restrictions that favored Europeans, but a comprehensive law in 1965 ushered in an era of increased diversity by opening doors to immigrants from various regions. In contemporary times, laws and presidential initiatives have been influenced by issues related to refugees, unauthorized immigration, and concerns about terrorism (Pew Research Center). Famous is Donald Trump‚Äôs proposition of building a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico to stop illegal migrants from Latin America. The project, already conceived in the 1940s and 1950s by the Democrats Roosevelt and Truman, assured the former President a large popular support (Mendoza).

The ongoing debate around immigration is reflected in the media that, according to Baum and Potter, transports the elite‚Äôs view to the population and vice versa, in a circular motion, shaping public discourse and opinion (42). We thus decided to analyze how the debate around migration in the United States changed during the years by considering a corpus of articles published by the New York Times between 1945 and 2023.



# Research Topic ‚úç
To investigate the discourse around migration in the United States further, we would like to research on the change in the media framing of migration in the United States, from the period of post-World War II or 1945 until present. The media that we will focus on is the articles in The New York Times, one of the most prominent media in the United States.

We focus on the contemporary era or 1945-2023, due to the post-war migration after the World War II in 1945 and other global major situations that causes a dynamic flow of migration throughout the years. There is a possibility of changes in the discourse on migration throughout the various flows of migration occurrences, therefore, we believe that this research topic is worth pursuing.


# Context üåê
In the pre-modern era, the US has experienced three main waves of immigration. The first and most notorious one, considered the basis of the foundation of the country, happened during the colonial era, in 1620, when around 100 individuals, eventually recognized as the Pilgrims, escaped religious persecution in Europe and reached what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, founding a colony. Shortly afterward around 20,000 members of the persecuted religion Puritanism established the Massachusetts Bay Colony, between 1630 and 1640. The second group of immigrants was composed of West Africans, sold and enslaved in the New World (History Channel).

Between 1815 and 1865, another substantial wave of immigration swept the United States, with a focus on Northern and Western European countries. Notably, one-third of the newcomers, driven by the mid-19th-century Irish famine, consisted of Irish immigrants, comprising nearly half of America's total immigrant population in the 1840s. Simultaneously, about 5 million Germans arrived, with many settling in the Midwest or urban centers like Milwaukee and St. Louis. This period also marked the influx of Asian immigrants, particularly around 25,000 Chinese individuals drawn by the California gold rush in the mid-1800s. The impact of these diverse migrations significantly shaped the demographic landscape of the United States during this era (History Channel).

The third wave of immigration took place at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Between 1880 and 1920, a transformative era of industrialization and urbanization in the United States witnessed the arrival of over 20 million immigrants, the majority coming from Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe. Notable were the 600,000 Italians arriving in that decade, totaling over 4 million by 1920. Concurrently, more than 2 million Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe sought refuge from religious persecution. The peak of immigration occurred in 1907, welcoming around 1.3 million legal entrants. However, World War I's outbreak in 1914 led to a decline in immigration. In response, the Immigration Act of 1924 established a quota system, limiting entry to 2 percent of each nationality based on the 1890 census, favoring Western European immigrants and barring those from Asia. This legislative shift marked a turning point in U.S. immigration policy (History Channel).

The first conspicuous wave of Latin American immigrants started in 1942 with the repeal of the Bracero Program, a diplomatic agreement between Mexico and the United States, that facilitated the migration of millions of Mexican workers to the U.S. under short-term agricultural labor contracts. Post-war, special legislation enabled the entry of refugees from Europe and the Soviet Union into the U.S. Additionally, after the 1959 communist revolution in Cuba, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Cuba were admitted to the United States. In 1965, the Immigration and Nationality Act was passed by Congress, eliminating nationality-based quotas and permitting Americans to sponsor relatives from their countries of origin (History Channel).

To contrast the flux of illegal immigrants from Central America, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), enacted in 1986, granted amnesty to undocumented immigrants who had been residing continuously in the country since 1982 and imposed penalties on employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants. Subsequently, in 1990, Congress passed the Immigration Act, aiming to facilitate skilled worker immigration and substantially increased the annual issuance of green cards. Those legislations created resistance among the restrictionists, who claimed that immigration had negative economic and social effects. All along the 1990s a series of reforms both at state and federal level, such as the California Propositions 187 and 227 or the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, tried to contain illegal immigration (Baxter and Nowrasteh).

In the early 2000s, President George W. Bush pursued a pro-immigration stance, particularly appealing to Hispanic voters with support for expanded legal immigration and legalization for undocumented immigrants. However, the 9/11 attacks prompted a shift in immigration policy, leading to the enactment of the USA Patriot Act, which expanded deportation powers and allowed detention without due process. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security followed, restructuring immigration enforcement agencies (Baxter and Nowrasteh).

The illegal immigration population peaked in 2007, becoming a prominent issue in the 2008 presidential election. Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, advocated for employer sanctions and earned legalization. By the 2012 presidential election, Obama, on the other hand, continued supporting comprehensive reform and targeted deportation for removing over 1.2 million illegal immigrants during his presidency. In comparison, Donald Trump removed fewer individuals, averaging approximately 81,415 per year during his term (Nowrasteh).


# Academic background üìó



# Data & Methodology üìà
For the corpus, we are analyzing 10,132 articles from The New York Times, from the year 1945-2023.

In building the corpus, due to the NYT API's constraints when generating the corpus, we generated the articles by breaking them into six different corpus and concatenate them accordingly.


# I. Lexical extraction üìä
To identify the pattern in the articles about migration and the United States, we will extract several things based on the corpus:

a. 10 most frequently used adjectives in the headline and lead paragraph

b. 10 most frequently used nouns in the headline and lead paragraph

c. 10 most frequently used verbs

d. Distribution of verbs by tenses

# Analysis
From the top 10 most used adjectives, the words that are utilized in the articles about migration and the United States depict novelty, hence 'new' as the most used adjective, which is related to how migration is related to new movement of people or new policies.

Other adjectives that are particular such as 'american' and 'political' also show how news about migration is portrayed in the New York Times, based on how the people or policy of United States, through the adjective 'american', perceive or receive migration movements. This shows how the news about migration is quite state-centric or being approached through the point of view of the state, instead of emphasizing on the migrants or the people.

The adjective such as 'political' also shows how the narrative about migration in the United States is regarded as a political issue. Instead of considering it as a regular phenomenon where people move from one country to another, the media is portraying migration as a political issue and link it with policies issued by the government.

# Analysis
In the articles about migration and the United States, using the named entity recognition, names of nationalities, religious and political groups that are often used are mostly related to the United States (7 nouns), and aside from that are 'Mexico', 'China', and 'Mexican'.

This shows that in the narrative portrayed in the articles from New York Times, narrative about migration in the United States shows how the migration impacted the U.S. or the 'Americans', and news about migration in the United States is dominantly related to China and Mexico or Mexicans.

This depicts the two countries that become the focus in the narrative of migration in the United States. China has become the U.S.' rising contender for global hegemony and has become the U.S.' political rival, therefore, it is common for the news in the U.S. to cover about China. Apparently, in the context of migration and the United States, China is also mentioned often which shows how the migration from China is also significant in the United States.

As for Mexico or mexican, it is also one of the main emphasize from the U.S. related to migration due to the high number of immigration from Mexico. The high amount of people who cross the border between Mexico and the U.S. becomes the prompt for the U.S. government, especially during Trump presidency, to build the walls that prevents more Mexican migrants to move to the United States.

From the results of the most used nouns, we can conclude that the narrative about migration and the United States is still heavily emphasized to two countries that are perceived to affect significantly to the United States, namely China and Mexico.
